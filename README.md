# Online-desktop-based-exam-java-project

In this project, we have designed and developed Software for Online Examination System in which there are
given 10 questions to play. User can save question by attempting move to next one, he/she can also bookmark
any question for the reconsideration while going to result and can go to the next question by clicking the next
button. Online Exams System fulfils the requirements of the institutes to conduct the exams online. We are
using here java array to store the questions, options and answers and not using database technology. With
the use of swing frames as container and buttons and checkboxes as their component, we have made this
Project more enhancing. Software provides the options to students to select the Questions with increasing
complexity levels if they want to achieve higher points resulting into better Grades, thus the software makes it
possible to provide three levels of Questions as per complexity levels of Good, Tough and Complex ones. The
scores are accordingly provided to the students with rules :beginner::beginner:(For Example) the Best grades
can only be achieved either by scoring more than 80 % correct responses of Good Questions and 25 % and 10 %
each correct responses from Tough and Complex Questions. But Students can also correctly answer larger
Questions from Tough and Complex Questions thus reducing the requirements of correctly answering the
Questions from Good Questions. Thus, we have formulated appropriate Rules for this provision with a timer for
specific time only.
The Software should serve the purpose of examining the students and their Result
computation. The Admin can see the registered students and their marks after they have
attempted the test. The Student can give the test and after submitting his answers, he can
check his result at the same time.
